![govuk-frontend 3.15.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/govuk--frontend%20version-3.15.0-005EA5?logo=gov.uk&style=flat)
[![Python package](https://github.com/LandRegistry/govuk-frontend-jinja/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LandRegistry/govuk-frontend-jinja/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)

**GOV.UK Frontend Jinja is a [community tool](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/resources-and-tools/) of the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/). The Design System team is not responsible for it and cannot support you with using it. Contact the [maintainers](#contributors) directly if you need [help](#support) or you want to request a feature.**

This repository provides a complete set of [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) macros that are kept up-to-date and 100% compliant with the original [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) Nunjucks macros. Porting is intentionally manual rather than automated to make updates simpler than maintaining an automated conversion routine. A [comprehensive test suite](https://github.com/surevine/govuk-frontend-diff) ensures compliance against the latest, and every subsequent, GOV.UK Frontend release.

## Compatibility

The following table shows the version of GOV.UK Frontend Jinja that you should use for your targeted version of GOV.UK Frontend:

| [1.3.0](https://github.com/LandRegistry/govuk-frontend-jinja/releases/tag/1.3.0) | <=[3.12.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v3.12.0) |
| [1.2.1](https://github.com/LandRegistry/govuk-frontend-jinja/releases/tag/1.2.1) | <=[3.11.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v3.11.0) |

Any other versions of GOV.UK Frontend not shown above _may_ still be compatible, but have not been tested and verified.

## How to use

After running `pip install govuk-frontend-jinja`, ensure that you tell Jinja where to load the templates from using the `PackageLoader` as follows:

```python
from flask import Flask
from jinja2 import ChoiceLoader, PackageLoader, PrefixLoader

app = Flask(__name__)

app.jinja_loader = ChoiceLoader(
    [
        PackageLoader("app"),
        PrefixLoader({"govuk_frontend_jinja": PackageLoader("govuk_frontend_jinja")}),
    ]
)
```

### Calling a Macro in your template

To use a component in your project templates you must import and call the component macro and pass the relevant options, for example:

```html
{%- from 'govuk_frontend_jinja/components/button/macro.html' import govukButton -%}

{{ govukButton({
  'text': "Save and continue"
}) }}
```

The options available to each component macro can be found in the original [GOV.UK Desing System Components](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/) documentation. Since this project is a like-for-like port, the only difference between the Nunjucks examples and their Jinja equivalents is having to quote key names, e.g. `'text'` instead of `text`.

## Running the tests

The tests are run in a GitHub actions pipeline but if you want to run them locally you will need to install [govuk-frontend-diff](https://github.com/surevine/govuk-frontend-diff).

There is a test server at `tests/utils/app.py` which you will need to run using the following command:

```bash
(cd tests/utils && python -m flask run --port 3000)
```

You can then run the tests using `govuk-frontend-diff` as follows:

```bash
./govuk-frontend-diff http://localhost:3000 --govuk-frontend-version=v3.15.0
```

This is all wrapped up in `./test.sh` for simplified running (Requires Docker).
